## 🎵 What is Loop?

Loop is a beautifully crafted, full-stack music streaming platform designed to adapt to your mood and listening habits in real time. Stream millions of tracks with zero buffering, zero ads, and a UI that feels alive — whether you're deep in a late-night study session, chasing that night-drive feeling, or getting hyped before the gym.

> *Music that listens back.*

Loop is built to production standards: encrypted end-to-end via HTTPS/TLS, CSP-hardened, rate-limited, and running on a globally distributed edge network with real-time cloud sync across all your devices.
